Project Diabetes

Team2:
Develop Classification models with
Diabetes <- Pregnancies +Glucose + BMI
Algorithms <- kNN, Logistic Regression, SVM

Commonly all three teams shall develop one classifier independently using Random Forest

Compare all the models by generating metrics:
1.Accuracy
2.Confusion Matrix
3.Precision and Recall
4.ROC AUC curves
