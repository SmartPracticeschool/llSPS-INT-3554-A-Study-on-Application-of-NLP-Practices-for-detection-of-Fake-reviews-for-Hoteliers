Four groups


1. Simple Linear Regression Methods

seond group - 2 students---- Ozone & Temperature DONE

2. Multiple Linear Regression Methods

second group - 2 students --- Ozone & Solar.R + Wind


3. Compare the models

Model_name  Input variables     Output variable    RMSE   R2_Score
model1        Solar.R             Ozone 
model 2       Solar.R, Temp       Ozone   



The best model is the one with least RMSE and high R2_Score
